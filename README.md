# PRODIGY_CS_01
# Caesar Cipher Implementation in Python

This Python script demonstrates the Caesar Cipher, a fundamental encryption and decryption method. The encryption and decryption algorithm works by shifting each letter with the number of positions (key) provided up or down the alphabet.

# Usage

pip install -r Requirements.txt

python3 main.py

# Modules

The application has the following modules:

Encryption

1. Gets the message for encryption
  
2. Obtains the encryption key

3. Performs the encryption operation
  
4. The Cipher is produced


Decryption

1. Gets the cipher for decryption
  
2. Obtains the encrypted key

3. Performs the decryption operation
  
4. The message is deciphered
